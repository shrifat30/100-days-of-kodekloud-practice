task - Create a user named siva with a non-interactive shell on App Server 3.
process - 
  1 - Find the login info of appserver 3 from the details link
  2 - ssh into App server 3 "ssh user@ip-address"
  3 - use command "sudo adduser username", then use password
  4 - check using "id username"
  5 - However, I did not use the proper command to create a non-interactive user which was "sudo adduser -s /sbin/nologin ammar"
  6 - So, I changed the changed the user to non-interactive shell by "sudo usermod -s /usr/sbin/nologin username"
  7 - It worked !!
